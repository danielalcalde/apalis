What is Apalis?
###############

Apalis is a python library for parallel computing. It focuses on enabling parallel computing with little overhead. In :ref:`ray` we compare Apalis
to ray in speed.

Getting started with Apalis
###########################
Apalis can be installed from PyPI:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install apalis

Apalis can send an object into a child process and interact with it through a Handler.
To send an object into a parallel process just:

.. code-block:: python

   import apalis
   import time

   class A:
    def expensive(self, x):
      time.sleep(1)
      return x
      
   a = A()
   obj = apalis.Handler(a) # Send object
   token = obj.expensive(5) # Sends the task to the object in the child process.
   token() # Calling the token yields the result of the operation.

The same can be done with multiple Handlers at once.

.. code-block:: python
    
   es = [apalis.Handler(A()) for _ in range(16)]
   tokens = [obj.expensive(5) for obj in objs]
   aplais.get(tokens) # Gets the results of the operations.

Apalis vs Ray
#############
Ray is the go-to option for parallel computing in python. It has a lot of functionality build in which makes it a good choice for a variety of projects.
The problem is that the functionality comes at the cost of a lot of overhead.
This is especially noticeable when parallelizing tasks that take less than **1ms** to complete.

In the figure bellow different tasks that take :math:`t_{single}` time are parallelized by both Apalis and Ray on a 16 core CPU.
The speedup from both methods is plotted against how expensive the task was, to begin with.
Apalis is faster than single-threaded for tasks that are slower than **0.04ms** while Ray is only better than single-threaded starting from **0.4ms**.
Note that the longer the task takes the closer to 16 times improvement we come.
